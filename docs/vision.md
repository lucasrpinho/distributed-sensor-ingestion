# Vision

## Purpose
This project is a **portfolio-focused distributed systems demo**. Its goal is to clearly demonstrate practical knowledge of:
- Event-driven architectures
- High-throughput data ingestion
- Backpressure handling
- Idempotent consumers
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

It is intentionally **not production-grade**.

## What This Project Is
- A local-only distributed system simulation
- A hands-on demonstration of architectural decisions
- A concise but realistic system that can be explained end-to-end in interviews

## What This Project Is NOT
- A SaaS or customer-facing application
- A long-term maintained system
- A benchmark-accurate load test
- A fully secured or hardened environment

## Time Constraint
- Designed to be completed in **3–5 days**
- After the final Git commit, no further development is expected
